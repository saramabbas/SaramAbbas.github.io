    Welcome! I'm **Saram Abbas**, a PhD researcher at Newcastle University using interpretable machine learning to improve how we predict cancer recurrence, especially in real-world clinical settings. My research focuses on developing transparent models like attention-enhanced neural networks, XGBoost hybrids, and neuro-symbolic AI to bring clarity to complex predictions.

    I'm particularly passionate about **making AI explainable for clinicians** and **scalable for underserved healthcare systems**. My work has been published in *Frontiers in Oncology* and accepted at *EMBC 2025*.

    Feel free to explore my publications, current projects, or connect via [GitHub](https://github.com/saramabbas) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saram-abbas/).
