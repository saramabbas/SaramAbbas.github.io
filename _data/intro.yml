        Welcome! I'm <strong>Saram Abbas</strong>, a PhD researcher at Newcastle University using interpretable machine learning to improve how we predict cancer recurrence, especially in real-world clinical settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research focuses on transparent models like attention-enhanced neural networks, XGBoost hybrids, and neuro-symbolic AI to bring clarity to complex predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about <strong>making AI explainable for clinicians</strong> and <strong>scalable for underserved healthcare systems</strong>. My work is published in <em>Frontiers in Oncology</em> and accepted at <em>EMBC 2025</em>.
