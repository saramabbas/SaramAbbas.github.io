Hey — I’m **Saram Abbas**, a PhD researcher in Explainable AI for oncology at Newcastle University. I design machine learning systems that do more than just predict — they explain. My goal? To build tools that doctors can actually use, trust, and understand — especially when the stakes are high.

Right now, I’m working on bladder cancer recurrence prediction using real-world NHS datasets like PHOTO and BOXIT. I built a hybrid XGBoost + attention model that hits an AUC of 0.83 — but more importantly, it tells you *why* it made the prediction. That’s the kind of clarity I believe clinicians deserve.

So far, I’ve published in *Frontiers in Oncology*, presented at EMBC 2025, and collaborated closely with clinicians to make sure the AI I build doesn’t just live in notebooks — it lives in clinics.

### 🔬 What I'm Into (Research-Wise)
- Interpretable AI for clinical decision-making
- Attention mechanisms, logic-based reasoning, and deep tabular models
- Making sense of small, noisy medical datasets
- Building tools that don’t just predict — they explain

### ⚙️ What I'm Into (Otherwise)

I’ve always been a builder at heart. I love pulling things apart to see how they work — from old radios to car engines. I’m a die-hard engineering enthusiast who thinks solder smoke smells like progress.

When I’m not debugging models or tweaking attention heads, you’ll probably find me reading about Islamic history, sketching dashboard layouts for fun, or explaining AI to someone over chai.

Also: I take too many photos. And if you ever want to talk about why the BMW E46 is still perfect, I’m your guy.

### 🌍 Where I’m From, Where I'm Going

I’m based in the UK, originally from Pakistan, and I care deeply about making AI that works for *everyone* — not just the ones with access to fancy hospitals. Interpretability isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s how you earn trust.
