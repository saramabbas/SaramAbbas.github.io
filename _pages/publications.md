### Conference Papers

**Attention-enabled Explainable AI for Bladder Cancer Recurrence Prediction**  
Accepted at *IEEE EMBC 2025*, Copenhagen  
[DOI: [arXiv:2505.00171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00171)]  
Presents a hybrid model combining XGBoost and attention-based neural networks. Demonstrates high predictive performance (AUC 0.83) on NHS datasets while maintaining interpretability suitable for clinical decision-making.

### Manuscripts in Preparation

**XGBoost Meets Attention: A Hybrid Cancer Model**  
Target journals: *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*, *npj Digital Medicine*  
Presents a hybrid AI architecture combining gradient-boosted trees with attention-based neural networks for NMIBC recurrence prediction. Balances accuracy with clinical transparency and deployability.

**Clinically Inherently-Interpretable Bladder Cancer Prediction Using Tsetlin Machines** 
Target journals: *European Urology*, *Computers in Biology and Medicine*  
Introduces a rule-based model using Tsetlin Machines to deliver inherently interpretable predictions on NHS clinical data without sacrificing performance.
